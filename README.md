# Object detection in an Urban Environment

## Setup

### Download data
For this project, we will be using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/). The files can be downloaded directly from the website as tar files or from the [Google Cloud Bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files/) as individual tf records.
 
 
```
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

source ~/.bashrc

gcloud auth login
```
### Split the original dataset into training, validation and test

```
python download_process.py --data_dir /home/workspace/data/ --temp_dir /home/backups/
```

### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Edit the config file

Now you are ready for training. As we explain during the course, the Tf Object Detection API relies on **config files**. The config that we will use for this project is `pipeline.config`, which is the config for a SSD Resnet 50 640x640 model. You can learn more about the Single Shot Detector [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf). 

First, let's download the [pretrained model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz) and move it to `training/pretrained-models/`. 

Now we need to edit the config files to change the location of the training and validation files, as well as the location of the label_map file, pretrained weights. We also need to adjust the batch size. To do so, run the following:
```
python edit_config.py --train_dir /home/workspace/data/train/ --eval_dir /home/workspace/data/val/ --batch_size 4 --checkpoint ./training/pretrained-models/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8/checkpoint/ckpt-0 --label_map label_map.pbtxt
```
A new config file has been created, `pipeline_new.config`.

## Training

You will now launch your very first experiment with the Tensorflow object detection API. Create a folder `training/reference`. Move the `pipeline_new.config` to this folder. You will now have to launch two processes: 
* a training process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=training/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=training/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_every_n=50
```
* an evaluation process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=training/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=training/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_dir=training/reference/
```

NOTE: both processes will display some Tensorflow warnings.

To monitor training, you can start a tensorboard instance by running the following command:

1. check the location of Tensorflow
```
pip show tensorflow
```

2. Go to that location you get from the above output.
```
cd /data/virtual_envs/sdc-c1-gpu-augment/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorboard
```
3. Execute the following command to launch the tensorboard.
```
python main.py --logdir=/home/workspace/training
```
4. open board in the web
```
localhost:6006
```

## Improve the performances
### Data augmentation

Most likely, this initial experiment did not yield optimal results. However, you can make multiple changes to the config file to improve this model. One obvious change consists in improving the data augmentation strategy. The [`preprocessor.proto`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/protos/preprocessor.proto) file contains the different data augmentation method available in the Tf Object Detection API. To help you visualize these augmentations, we are providing a notebook: `Explore augmentations.ipynb`. Using this notebook, try different data augmentation combinations and select the one you think is optimal for our dataset. Justify your choices in the writeup. 

Keep in mind that the following are also available:
* experiment with the optimizer: type of optimizer, learning rate, scheduler etc
* experiment with the architecture. The Tf Object Detection API [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) offers many architectures. Keep in mind that the `pipeline.config` file is unique for each architecture and you will have to edit it. 


### Creating an animation
#### Export the trained model
Modify the arguments of the following function to adjust it to your models:
```
python .\exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path training/experiment0/pipeline.config --trained_checkpoint_dir training/experiment0/ckpt-50 --output_directory training/experiment0/exported_model/
```

Finally, you can create a video of your model's inferences for any tf record file. To do so, run the following command (modify it to your files):
```
python inference_video.py -labelmap_path label_map.pbtxt --model_path training/experiment0/exported_model/saved_model --tf_record_path /home/workspace/data/test/tf.record --config_path training/experiment0/pipeline_new.config --output_path animation.mp4
```
